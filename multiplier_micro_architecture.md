# Challenge: Multiplier Micro-architecture

Design a full precision multiplier that inputs two 401-bit unsigned operands and outputs their 802-bit product.
The design must be mathematically correct and should consider the following optimization parameters:
- Low area
- High throughput
- Low latency

The design is for a **Xilinx Ultrascale+ device** and should be focused around sensible usage of the **DSP48E2 IP.**
‚Äç
### Key considerations should include:
- DSP48E2 capabilities and utilization
- Input and output interfaces
- Interconnecting and cascading
- Peripherals such as BRAM and CLB
- Pipelining and folding

It is strongly desired for a solution to consider multiple architectures and discuss the tradeoffs between them.

The solution should be presented in the form of detailed block diagrams. Online tools such as draw.io can be used.
